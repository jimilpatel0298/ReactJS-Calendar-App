# Calendar Web App

This project was created using ReactJS. It is a minimal web application showing a calendar. Users can add events to particular dates and delete them if not needed. The application is connected to Firebase to provide database functionalities. A user can close the application and still get the last used state when coming back to the page.

The application even has the functionality to Sign Up and Login. Users can register using their email address and password and use the same credentials to login later to use the service.
